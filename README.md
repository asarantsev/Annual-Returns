# Annual-Returns
Annual S&amp;P 500 returns (nominal or real, price or total) are not Gaussian. But after dividing by annual realized volatility computed by Angel Piotrowski, these returns become Gaussian. These returns are also independent identically distributed, whether before or after normalization. Angel used the quantile-quantile plots, Shapiro-Wilk and Jarque-Bera tests to judge normality. She used autocorrelation function plots for Q and for |Q| to judge whether Q are independent identically distributed. See results in https://my-finance.org/2025/02/19/make-sp-returns-iid-gaussian/
